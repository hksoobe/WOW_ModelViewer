# WOW_ModelViewer
My look into improving and updating the out-of-date and seemingly abandoned WOW model viewer we all know and love.

The goal is to, primarily, make the software compatible with the latest version of WOW. Secondary goals are to add support for viewing models without accessing raw database everytime, improve UI, some functionality improvements.
