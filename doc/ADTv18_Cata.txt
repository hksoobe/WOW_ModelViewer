Cataclysm has split ADT files into 4 separate files, changing how it's read. I did a lot of exploring and documenting to figure this out, and I thought I would share my findings.

Note: MCNK is now used to contain any sort of list.

New format:


-Base File (xxx.adt)
MVER, (same)
MHDR, (same layout, but many vars are now all Zeros.)
MH2O, (same)
MCNK
 size, uint32
 header (same as original MCNK header, I think...)
 MCVT
  count
  float * count
 MCCV, (same)
 MCNR, (same)
 MCSE, (same)
MFBO, (same)

Object File (xxx_obj0.adt, stores M2 & WMO references)
MVER, (same)
MMDX, (same)
MMID, (same)
MWMO, (same)
 MWID, (same)
MDDF, (same)
MODF, (same)
MCNK * (unknown)
 size, uint32
 MCRD (Not sure what this is for...)
  size, uint32
  uint32

Texture file (xxx_tex0.adt or xxx_tex1.adt)
MVER, (same)
MAMP
 size, uint32
 uint32, tex file number (xxx_tex0.adt, xxx_tex1.adt)
MTEX, (same)
MCNK
 size, uint32
 MCLY (same)
 MCAL (same)



Didn't have time to figure out what all of it is or does, but at least this should start us down the right path.
