r661
Thanks Kjasi for following patches
- WMO exporting will now save the textures as their original filenames. This will reduce the overall number of files made when exporting many WMOs with the same textures. Surface names have been changed to reflect their texture's path & filename. This will make sorting & managing exported textures easier.
- Fixed the inverted z-axis with WMO->LWO files.

r659
- Fixed particle bug that may contains invalid row and col number and cause WMV crash
- Added Bezier Implementation in animation by Tigurius

r564

Thanks Daid! He provides a nice patch on WMO handling.
http://www.wowmodelviewer.org/forum/index.php?topic=5198.0

-Add mouse control to WMO viewing (left: rotate, right: move, left+right: move height, similar to UnrealEd)
-Increase the viewing distance by 500% (those WMOs can be huge)
-Fix a few assertions in debug builds
-Add export from WMO to OBJ

The WMO export does NOT export the doodads. So if you export dalaran for example (largest thing I could find) you don't get any small objects like trees, benches, banners. Note that an export of Dalaran is 200MB, and contains over 200 textures. Even without the doodads.

r555
- New Feature: File -> Discovery NPC
- New Feature: Character -> Load NPC Outfit
- Discovery Item will output to discoveryitems.csv

Run File -> Discovery Item once. It will generate a discoveryitems.csv under your WMV dir. 

And then try to use File -> Discovery NPC to get new NPC info. 

Use File -> View NPC, and you will see some T10 sets in the end.

Use Character - Bloodelf - female - bloodelffemale.m2, and use Character -> Load NPC Outfit to make them wear T10 sets.

r548
- New feature: Menu -> File -> Discovery Item
  It may take a long time on a slow machine.

r536
- Model exporting to Ms3D have bones now

r528
- PTR compatible

r527
- fixed eye glow
  - Add a "Show Eye Glow" feature under the characters menu to enable/disable character/deathknight eye glows

r521
- fixed particle system effects
  - [Magnett] Several items have their particles messed up in the sense that their light effect is extremely exaggerated.
  - [Magnett] The old WMV had a simple option, under Effects I think, to disable (all?) particles that fixed this. If this one does, I can't find it. I can    
    disable them separately in model control, but this doesn't always work as sometimes I can only select the character model itself and not the shoulders/weapon.

r517
- fixed some crash issues

r505
- [blayaden] 2h off-hand weapons when sheathed overlap on the main-hand 2h weapon.  Arms warriors probably would find this annoying, since they are supposed to criss-cross on the back.

r498
- fixed "Save Equipment"

r486
- [Bug][handclaw] Belts lost it's texture_torso_lower

r482
- [Bug][zUkUu] some odd looking "shadows" on the textures.

r481
- [Bug][zUkUu] as you can see the scaling of the shoulders isn't correct.
- [Bug][blayaden] Quiver's are like shoulder cannons again though. 

r475
- [Request][Kjasi] Being able to export all textures, with file paths preserved. So in the export directory, the files would be in the folders that they exist in in the MPQ. Example: Character/NightElf/Male/Eyeglow.tga would be exported when I export all to TGA. (I keep my LW texture filepaths the same as the MPQ files)

r473
- fix eye close

r472

r446
- [Pinkhair] Export texture can export tga format

r441
- [Frozen_Death_Knight]: Blood Elf male right leg has a really weird stretch from the knee that is almost as long as the thigh itself (look it up and try some emotes)
- [Frozen_Death_Knight]: Human Females' jaws and fingers are gone in the character-folder as well as on many creature- and NPC-folders
- [herosatoshi]: male gnome and famale tauren are also missing most of their fingers.. except the thumbs 
- creature\Motocyclevechicle doesn't have wheel
